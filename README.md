## Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Binaries (Recommended)

1. Install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation)
2. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/fx64b/skool-loom-dl/releases)
3. Choose the appropriate binary for your platform:
   - **Linux (x64)**: `skool-loom-dl-linux-amd64`
   - **Linux (ARM64)**: `skool-loom-dl-linux-arm64`
   - **Windows (x64)**: `skool-loom-dl-windows-amd64.exe`
   - **Windows (ARM64)**: `skool-loom-dl-windows-arm64.exe`
   - **macOS (Intel)**: `skool-loom-dl-darwin-amd64`
   - **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `skool-loom-dl-darwin-arm64`
4. Make it executable (Linux/macOS): `chmod +x skool-loom-dl-*`

### Option 2: Build from Source

#### Prerequisites

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (1.18 or newer)
2. Install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation)

#### Building the Tool

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fx64b/skool-loom-dl
cd skool-loom-dl

# Build the executable
go build
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Recommended: Using email/password for authentication
./skool-loom-dl -url="https://skool.com/yourschool/classroom/your-classroom" -email="your@email.com" -password="yourpassword"

# Alternative: Using cookies for authentication
./skool-loom-dl -url="https://skool.com/yourschool/classroom/your-classroom" -cookies="cookies.json"
```

### Important Options

```
-url        URL of the skool.com classroom page (required)
-email      Email for Skool login (recommended auth method)
-password   Password for Skool login (used with email)
-cookies    Path to cookies file (alternative to email/password)
-output     Directory to save videos (default: "downloads")
-wait       Page load wait time in seconds (default: 2)
-headless   Run browser headless (default: true, set false for debugging)
```

### Authentication Methods

**Email/Password (Recommended)**
```bash
./skool-loom-dl -url="https://skool.com/yourschool/classroom/path" -email="your@email.com" -password="yourpassword"
```

**Cookies (Alternative)**
```bash
./skool-loom-dl -url="https://skool.com/yourschool/classroom/path" -cookies="cookies.json"
```

> **Note:** Email/password authentication is more reliable as it handles session management automatically. Cookie-based authentication may fail if cookies expire or are invalid.

## Getting Cookies (if needed)

If you choose to use cookies instead of email/password:

1. Install a browser extension like "Cookie-Editor" (Chrome) or "Cookie Quick Manager" (Firefox)
2. Log in to your Skool.com account
3. Export cookies as JSON or Netscape format
4. Save the file and use it with the `-cookies` parameter

## Troubleshooting

- **No videos found**: Verify your authentication and classroom URL
- **Authentication fails**: Use email/password instead of cookies
- **Page loads incomplete**: Increase wait time with `-wait=5` or higher
- **Download errors**: Update yt-dlp (`pip install -U yt-dlp`)
- **Login issues**: Try `-headless=false` to see the browser and debug
- **Specific video errors**: Check if the video is still available on Loom

## Development and Testing

### Running Tests

This project includes comprehensive unit and integration tests.

#### Unit Tests

Run unit tests with coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
go test -v ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -v -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic ./...

# View coverage report
go tool cover -func=coverage.out

# Generate HTML coverage report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
```

The unit tests cover:
- Loom URL extraction from HTML (share and embed URLs)
- Cookie parsing (JSON and Netscape formats)
- Cookie format conversion
- Utility functions

#### Integration Tests

Run Docker-based integration tests to verify the full application with yt-dlp:

```bash
# Make the script executable (first time only)
chmod +x test-integration.sh

# Run integration tests
./test-integration.sh
```

The integration tests verify:
- Docker image builds successfully
- Binary is executable in the container
- yt-dlp is installed and functional
- Chromium is available
- ffmpeg is available
- Proper error handling

### Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing:

1. **Lint and Build** (`lint-and-build.yml`): Runs on every push and PR
   - Lints code with golangci-lint
   - Builds the project
   - Runs unit tests with coverage reporting

2. **Docker Integration Tests** (`docker-integration-test.yml`): Runs on every push and PR
   - Builds the Docker image
   - Runs integration tests in a containerized environment

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

### Development Guidelines

1. Write tests for new functionality
2. Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
3. Run linter: `golangci-lint run ./...`
4. Maintain or improve code coverage
5. Update documentation as needed

### Creating Releases (Maintainers)

To create a new release with cross-platform binaries:

1. Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/fx64b/skool-loom-dl/actions)
2. Select "Build and Release" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter the desired version (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
